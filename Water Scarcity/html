						<i>Water scarcity is the lack of sufficient available water resources to meet the demands of water usage within a region.

						The increase in water demand is a contribution of various factors including growing population, increased agricultural needs, industrial use  and  for electricity production.
						<br>
						Large amounts of industrial pollutants dumped in the rivers are responsible for destroying and leading to water shortage of the whole planet.
				
						Pesticides and fertilizers used in agriculture also get mixed with water bodies and pollute them.<br>
				 
						Overuse of tube wells for irrigation and use of bore wells for  domestic use also leads to over exploitation of underground water , decreasing the level  water table  resulting in water scarcity.<br>
				
						The problem of water waste is severe in countries where people are using the traditional inefficient irrigation methods for  agricultural land.<br>

						Government should invest to build more dams to fulfil the water demands and reduce the water shortage
				
						Water scarcity is a growing problem in many parts of the world.<br> It is caused by a combination of factors, including climate change, population growth, and poor water management practices.</i><br><br>

								<li>According to UN-Water 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries</li>
				
								<li>According to UNICEF, 1.42 billion people – including 450 million children – live in areas of high or extremely high water vulnerability</li>
				
								<li>785 million people lack access to basic water services</li>
				
								<li>The WHO reports that 884 million people lack access to safe drinking water</li>
				
								<li>Two-thirds of the world’s population experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year</li>
				
								<li>The Global Water Institute estimates that 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030</li>
				
								<li>3.2 billion people live in agricultural areas with high water shortages or scarcity</li>
				
								<li>Approximately 73% of people affected by water shortages live in Asia</li>
				
								<li>The global water crisis is a women’s issue: In what UNICEF calls “a colossal waste of time,” women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours hauling water every day</li>
				
								<li>Diarrhea kills 2,195 children every day—more than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined—and can be caused by lack of access to clean water and sanitation services</li>
				
								<li>Climate change,Population growth</li>
				
								<li>Poor water management practices and Overuse of water resources</li>
